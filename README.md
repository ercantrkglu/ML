# Titanic Disaster Prediction
Titanic disaster is one of the most known accidents in history. In summary, Titanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City.
Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking at the time the deadliest of a single ship in the West and the deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship to date.

In my first project, we will discuss the Titanic dataset, which is the most basic project of kaggle, for data analysis on this subject. Our goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether the passengers on board were killed in the crash.

We will follow the general roadmap in data analysis processes:
- We will look over the dataset and try to get a basic idea.
- We will use visualizations for this.
- Then, We will look for relationship between variables via statistical calculations. We will make changes to the data if necessary.
- We will examine missing and contradictory observations and make the necessary preliminary processes before modeling.
- Finally, I will fit my model and end my project..
